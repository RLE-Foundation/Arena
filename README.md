# Arena: A Leaderboard for Reinforcement Learning Agents.
An arena for reinforcement learning agents.
* This project serves as a  reinforcement learning leaderboard to showcase the performance of different user-uploaded models across various Benchmarks. 
* Users can submit their models and compare their results on a variety of standard test sets.

## Upload Your Agent
1. Visit [Arena](https://arena.rllte.dev/arena/);
2. Select a benchmark, an environment, and a specific version;
3. Enter your github username and the link to your code;
4. Click "Submit" to evaluate your agent and get a unique ID;
5. Check the [leaderboard](https://arena.rllte.dev/). 
<!-- 
Prepare Your Model: Make sure your model is trained on one of the supported Benchmarks.
2. Create a Pull Request: Submit a pull request with your model details, including:
* Model description
* Benchmark results
* Any relevant links (e.g., paper, code)
3. Leaderboard Update: Once your PR is reviewed and merged, your model will be added to the leaderboard. -->

## Rules
Only original models (not copied from others) will be considered.
Submissions must provide sufficient details to ensure reproducibility of the results.
Performance is evaluated based on specific metrics for each Benchmark.
Ensure that all code is properly documented and publicly accessible for verification.
## Contributions
We welcome contributions! If you'd like to add more Benchmarks, improve the leaderboard, or suggest any new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
